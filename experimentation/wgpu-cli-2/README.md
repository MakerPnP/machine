# WGPU - cli - 2

This experimentation attempts to use WGPU to render a 3D scene to set of png files.

Also includes an unfinished attempt to render step files.

It is based on the [screen-13-cli-1](../screen-13-cli-1) example.

## Running

```
cargo run --release
```

## Output

The program generates a png file called `asserts/cube_nnn.png` (the first one is shown below)

![output](assets/cube_001.png)

## Models

Step files come from here: https://www.3dcontentcentral.com/parts/part.aspx?id=263553&catalogid=171
